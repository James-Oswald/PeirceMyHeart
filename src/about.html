        <h3>What are Existential Graphs?</h3>
        <p>
          Proposed by <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Sanders_Peirce">Charles 
          Sanders Peirce</a></cite>, an <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_graph">
          Existential Graph</a></cite> is a visual, also called diagrammatic, representation of some logical expression. 
          There are three types of Existential Graphs: Alpha, Beta and Gamma.
          In Peirce My Heart, we have implemented only Alpha Existential Graphs (AEGs).        
        </p>

        <h4>The components of an Alpha Existential Graph</h4>
        AEGs are isomorphic to <cite>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propositional_calculus">Propositional Logic</a></cite>.
        This means, simply, that all conclusions reachable through Propositional Logic are also reachable through AEGs.
        These following three components make up all AEGs: 
        <dl>
          <dt>The Sheet of Assertion</dt>
          <dd>Blank page on which the graph is constructed. May be referred to as "The Sheet."</dd>

          <dt>Atoms</dt>
          <dd>Letters or phrases used to represent propositions. Peirce My Heart only supports letters.</dd>

          <dt>Cuts</dt>
          <dd>
            Fully closed curves representing negations. Every atom and cut contained within 
            some other cut is considered negated. Cuts can be nested within
            other cuts. Empty cuts, i.e. cuts that do not contain anything, are 
            allowed to exist on The Sheet. Each cut corresponds to an integer cut "level" in 
            the graph, and a nested cut corresponds to one cut level deeper than the level of its parent.
          </dd>
        </dl>

        <h4>How AEGs Work</h4>
        Anything drawn on The Sheet is asserted as <b>True</b>. Phrases, subgraphs and The 
        Sheet itself may evaluate to <b>True</b> or <b>False.</b> <br/>
        Since everything drawn on The Sheet is <b>True</b>, placing multiple atoms on the 
        same level may be considered creating a conjunction between these atoms. This further applies to 
        atoms and cuts on the same level (Note: Asserting that multiple propositions 
        are <b>True</b> all at the same time means that the conjunction of these propositions 
        is <b>True</b> as well). <br/>
        Because everything contained within a cut is negated, and The Sheet corresponds to <b>True</b>, an empty cut corresponds to
        <b>False.</b> <br/>
        AEGs contain functionality to represent <b>AND</b> and <b>NOT</b>, as seen in propositional
        logic. Further, all propositional connectives can be represented in an AEG 
        by using some combination of <b>AND</b> and <b>NOT.</b> For instance, 
        <div style="margin: auto; text-align: center;">
          A <b>OR</b> B <br/>
          can be represented as <br/>
          <b>NOT(NOT</b>A <b>AND (NOT</b>B<b>)</b>)
        </div>

        In an AEG, this would be represented by first drawing a cut on the Sheet of Assertion.
        The, we would draw 2 smaller cuts within the first cut, and draw <b>A</b> within
        one and <b>B</b> within the other.
