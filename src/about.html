    <p style="font-family: Garamond, serif;">
    Peirce was innovative as to how the structure of the AEG should look like, so he utilized alpha and beta symbols. Alpha and beta symbols were used to correspond to the logic of statements, predicates, and quantifiers.  These types of visual notation will express the logical expression that is depicted by Peirce. Another aspect of AEGs would be how they can be read in multiple ways that eliminates the need for additional special symbols.
