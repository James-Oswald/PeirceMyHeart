# PeirceMyHeart (InDev)

[![Code Style: Google](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-google-blueviolet.svg)](https://github.com/google/gts)

A web application for modeling Charles Peirce's Alpha Existential Graph System. In development for UAlbany 499.

## Development

**All listed commands should be run in the project root**

### Installing Development Tools

1. Install *Node.js* and *npm*. [Follow the instructions here](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

2. Download all dev dependencies using npm. This command will read all dev
dependencies from `package.json` and install them.
```bash
npm install 
```

### Familiarizing yourself with Development Tools

We use the following development tools: 

1. **npm** : npm (node package manager) is a package manager for nodejs projects. We use it exclusively
to install and manage the rest of our development dependencies such as typescript, webpack, etc.
We also use it to invoke all core development tools via `npm run`

2. **webpack** : webpack is an asset bundler and build system for large web projects with 
many types of resources such as typescript. Additionally, it provides excellent debugging features.
We use it as a build system for Typescript and asset compressor. 
 
3. **gts** : gts (Google TypeScript Style) is a set of style guidelines and tools for typescript
consistent and readable formatting. It provides defaults for the following tools we use:
    * **eslint** : an extensible linter for javascript and typescript code. It catches 
      many semantic errors such as unused variables.
    * **prettier** : an opinionated code formatter that enforces a code style. It enforces
      syntactic style such as indentation and spacing.

## Linting

Lint the code to make sure your code follows all gts style guidelines. To lint gts will invoke eslint and prettier, based
on its defaults and our modifications.
Run the following to get style guideline messages about your code:
```bash
npm run lint
```
Github will prevent you from merging your PR until your code meets style guidelines 
(npm run lint exists with no errors) so it is important to stay on top of this.

gts is a very powerful tool and provides the ability to automatically fix most code
you write to be inline with the projects style guidelines. We invoke it through
```bash
npm run fix
```

## Building
Build the project to the `/dist/` directory using webpack in either development or production mode.
In production mode, all code will be compiled and compressed into a single file to ensure extremely
fast loading of the web page, however debugging will be impossible. To build in production mode
run:
```bash
npm run build
```

In development mode, webpack will not apply compression and will include a typescript source map with
the compiled js files, allowing you to seamlessly debug the application in browser. To build in
development mode run:
```bash
npm run buildDev
```

## Debugging

Webpack comes bundled with some very powerful debugging tools, the first of which is live
recompilation, during which any edits you make to the source file are immediately compiled 
and changes in the application appear right away in a corresponding web browser window. To 
open a browser window and start listening for changes you can use the following command:
```bash
npm run liveEdit
```

Live editing is very cool but if you want to debug you would have to set breakpoints in the browser debugger
which can be annoying. In order to use VS Code debugger while the browser is open is a two step
process. First, launch the webpack development server with:
```bash
npm run vscDebug
```
Then go to the VS Code debug window and select the "Debug Chrome" configuration and run it (Other browsers can be
supported through the correct extensions). A new chrome window will open attached to the webpack
development server, any vs code breakpoints triggered in chrome will be jumped to in VSC.


### Root Files and Folders Overview
```
/.github/ : The code for github workflows this project uses, used for automatically deploying the site when a new branch is merged into main. 

/src/ : source code for the application 

/.eslintignore : list of .js and .ts files the linter shouldn't look at

/.eslintrc.json : config for the linter, which catches semantic errors in your typescript code.

/.gitignore : list of files and folders shouldn't be uploaded with git version control

/.prettierrc.js : config for prettier, which catches syntactic errors in your typescript code.

/LICENSE : The legal jargon for who can use and sell the project, we are open source under the MIT License.

/package.json : main NPM file, contains information about the project and development dependencies.

/package-lock.json : (Autogenerated by NPM do not edit) NPM record of all versions of all dev dependencies and sub-dependencies used for this project.

/README.md : the information file you're reading right now.

/tsconfig.json : config for the typescript compiler.

/webpack.common.js : Main config file for webpack, specifies how different files from /src/ should be processed, provides common settings used in both development and production mode.

/webpack.dev.js : development mode config webpack file

/webpack.prod.js : production mode config webpack file
