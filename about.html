        <h3>What are Existential Graphs?</h3>
        <p>
          Proposed by <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Sanders_Peirce">Charles 
          Sanders Peirce</a></cite>, an <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_graph">
          Existential Graph</a></cite> is a diagrammatic or visual representation of a logical expression. 
          There are 3 types of Existential Graphs: Alpha Existential Graphs, Beta Existential Graphs and
          Gamma Existential Graphs. In our application, we cover Alpha Existential Graphs.        
        </p>

        <h4>The parts of an Alpha Existential Graph (AEG)</h4>
        Alpha Existential Graphs are a form of Existential Graphs that are isomorphic to <cite>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propositional_calculus">Propositional Logic</a></cite>
        Propositional Logic. Graphs of this system can be used to construct entire propositional 
        logic statements with just 3 components: 
        <dl>
          <dt>Sheet of Assertion</dt>
          <dd>The blank page on which the graph is constructed.</dd>

          <dt>Atoms</dt>
          <dd>The letters or phrases which are used to represent the propositions.</dd>

          <dt>Cuts</dt>
          <dd>
            Fully closed curves that are used to represent negation. Everything contained within 
            the cut will be considered to be negated. Cuts can be nested and concatenated with 
            other cuts. Empty cuts, i.e. cuts that do not contain anything within them, are 
            allowed to be present on the graph. Each cut represents a "level" in 
            the graph; a nested cut represents one level deeper than the level of its parent cut.
          </dd>
        </dl>

        <h4>How AEGs Work</h4>
        Anything drawn on this sheet is asserted to be <b>True</b>. Phrases, subgraphs and even the 
        entire graph can be equated to <b>True</b> or <b>False.</b> <br/>
        Since everything drawn on the sheet is considered <b>True</b>, placing multiple atoms on the 
        same levels can be considered as a conjunction between the atoms. This further applies to 
        atoms and cuts on the same level as well (Note: Asserting that multiple propositions 
        are True all at the same time in turn holds that the conjunction of those propositions 
        is True as well). <br/>
        Everything contained within a cut is considered negated. As such, an empty cut represents
        <b>False.</b> <br/>
        An AEG introduces functionality to represent <b>AND</b> and <b>NOT</b> as seen in propositional
        logic. Furthermore, all other propositional connectives can be represented in an AEG just 
        by using <b>AND</b> and <b>NOT.</b> For instance, 
        <div style="margin: auto; text-align: center;">
          A <b>OR</b> B <br/>
          can be represented as <br/>
          <b>NOT( NOT</b>A <b>AND (NOT</b>B<b>)</b>)
        </div>

        In an AEG, this would be represented by first drawing a <b>CUT</b> on the Sheet of Assertion.
        The, we would draw 2 smaller <b>CUTs</b> within the first <b>CUT</b>, and draw <b>A</b> within
        one and <b>B</b> within the other.
